# Block B – Age Structure & Demographic Risk

## Core Insight

Countries combining **low child population share** with **accelerating ageing momentum** face the highest long-term demographic risk, even when current dependency ratios still appear manageable.

Static indicators capture the current level of pressure, while **dynamic metrics reveal how rapidly demographic conditions are deteriorating**.

## Early-Warning Countries (Accelerating Ageing Momentum)

The strongest positive ageing momentum is observed in:

- North Macedonia (+0.084)
- Poland (+0.079)
- Serbia (+0.075)
- Croatia (+0.067)
- Slovakia (+0.062)

These countries represent **early-warning cases**, where demographic pressure is intensifying faster than in previous decades. Even if current dependency ratios remain below EU peaks, the speed and direction of change imply rising long-term fiscal and labor-market stress.

## Key Takeaway

Demographic risk is not defined solely by today’s population structure, but by the interaction between **ageing speed**, **ageing acceleration**, and the availability of **future workforce replacement**.

This framework provides a robust foundation for risk segmentation and forward-looking demographic analysis in subsequent project stages.
