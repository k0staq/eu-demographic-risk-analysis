# Block A – Population Trends

## Key Findings

Eastern and Balkan countries exhibit sustained relative population decline of up to 2% annually, indicating **structural demographic shrinkage** rather than temporary population shocks.

Western and Northern Europe display stable or mildly positive population trends, largely driven by migration inflows rather than natural population growth.

Absolute population changes are heavily skewed by country size, making **relative growth rates (YoY %) a more appropriate basis for cross-country comparison**.

## Interpretation

Long-term population dynamics across Europe are increasingly polarized. While migration can temporarily offset decline in parts of Western Europe, relative trend analysis reveals persistent structural contraction in large parts of Central, Eastern, and Balkan Europe. These patterns form the foundation for subsequent ageing and workforce risk analysis.
