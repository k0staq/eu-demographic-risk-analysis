# Block C – Demographic Risk Segmentation

## Core Insight

Countries with low child population share and accelerating ageing momentum face the highest long-term demographic risk, even when current dependency ratios remain moderate.

This pattern highlights **structural demographic dead-ends** rather than temporary imbalances.

---

## Methodology Overview

Block C combines normalized demographic indicators into a composite risk score covering:

- Dependency pressure
- Ageing speed
- Ageing momentum
- Child population share
- Population growth volatility
- Long-term population trend

Risk scores are evaluated under multiple weighting scenarios (baseline, ageing-heavy, fertility-heavy) to test robustness.

---

## Key Findings

- Countries classified as high-risk remain consistently high-risk across alternative scenarios
- Czechia and Slovakia rank above the EU average under all tested assumptions
- Relative country positioning remains stable, indicating limited sensitivity to modelling choices
- Risk patterns align strongly with regional and post-communist peer groups

---

## Interpretation

Elevated demographic risk in Central and Eastern Europe reflects **structural population dynamics**, not short-term shocks.  
Scenario testing confirms that demographic risk is persistent and likely to intensify without structural policy intervention.
