# Block D – Demographic Outlook & Forward-Looking Risk

## Population Outlook (Trend-Based)

Trend-based projections indicate diverging demographic trajectories between Czechia and Slovakia. While Czechia’s total population is projected to remain broadly stable in the medium term, Slovakia exhibits a gradual population decline.

This divergence reflects **structural demographic dynamics** rather than short-term migration shocks, signalling differing long-term demographic sustainability paths.

## Workforce Support Dynamics

Workforce support ratios in both Czechia and Slovakia decline steadily, indicating a shrinking economic base relative to the elderly population.

While Slovakia maintains a structurally higher support ratio, the downward trajectory is similar in both countries, suggesting **shared long-term pressure on labor markets and public finances**.

## Risk vs. Future Decline – Quadrant Interpretation

Countries located in the upper-right quadrant combine **elevated current demographic risk** with **projected population decline**, indicating structurally persistent demographic pressure rather than short-term volatility.

Czechia and Slovakia both sit above the EU average risk level, with Slovakia exhibiting a steeper projected population decline. This positioning highlights a **regional demographic pattern consistent with post-communist peer dynamics**, rather than an EU-wide anomaly.
